- 👋 Hi, this is @ideaPadDAO, we are planing to build an idea launchpad for starters.
- 👀 Publish your idea on ideaPad regardless it's a big dreaming or minus thought, fund it by others and sharing outcomes through the ideaHub vault.
- 🌱 It's a long run, but we already start it, carefully, seriously and meaningfully. 
- 💞️ Join us if you have a good idea :)
- 📫 ideaPad.app
